# Dataflow Design

## Overview
The primary purpose of the dataflow gen2 is to transform data as it moves it from one place to another, so since the data is being moved from the lakehouse to the gold warehouse, there's going to be heavy transformations in it but in this section im not going to go deep into DAX code, you can refer to the Code folder for that part.
